# Coffee-shop-analysis-using-Excel

This is a fully interactive dashboard which shows KPIs and different charts indicating the performance of a coffee shop in Manhattan, USA. The main objective of this project is to analyze the performance of the coffee shop over a period of 6 months and to increase the sales of the particular coffee shop. I have utilized Pivot tables and pivot charts from Excel to create the interactive dashboard. Please Take a look at the xlsx file that contains the dataset, pivot tables and the Dashboard. Or directly take a look at the screenshot present in one of the files.
